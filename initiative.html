<h1><b><u>OUR INITIATIVE</u></b></h1>
<h3><i>Our aim is to try and resolve environmental problems and foster peace and harmony.
Our motive involves the inclusion and implementation of SDGs in rural areas as well.
The era of environmental stability draws to a close, thanks to urbanization but if we are to survive, one must awaken. </i></h3>
<h2> We must prevent the all-out resource war where climatic catastrophes will complement the massacre of millions. </h2>
